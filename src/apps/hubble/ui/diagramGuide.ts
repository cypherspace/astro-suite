        <summary>The straight line</summary>
        <div class="info-section-body">
          <p>The blue line is your best fit through the points. Its
          slope is your measured Hubble constant H₀. The grey dashed
          line is the currently-accepted published value of 70
          km/s/Mpc. If your line is steeper, you've measured a faster
          expansion; shallower, a slower one. You're not aiming for
          an exact match, and you probably won't get one. The value
          changes depending on which galaxies you have plotted and
          how you've measured them — even professional astronomers
          disagree by ±5 km/s/Mpc depending on which galaxies they
          use.</p>

        <div class="info-section-body">
          <p>A galaxy plotted above your best-fit line is moving away
          faster than its distance suggests. There are two common
          reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Peculiar velocity</strong>. The galaxy has
              its own motion through space, on top of the universe's
              expansion. A galaxy falling toward a massive cluster,
              for example, would look like it's receding faster than
              Hubble's law predicts.</li>
            <li><strong>You over-estimated the redshift.</strong>
              This process is quite difficult. It's sometimes
              difficult to determine the right spectral lines to
              pick or their exact position. Some redshifts are very
              small, so the spectrum panel is sensitive to where
              exactly you click — a tiny error in λ<sub>observed</sub>
              changes the velocity by a big number.</li>

          <p>Slower than expected — the same physics in reverse. Most
          strikingly, the Local Group galaxies (Andromeda, M33, the
          Magellanic Clouds) plot at or below v = 0. They're not
          following Hubble's law at all because gravity binds them
          to the Milky Way.</p>

        <div class="info-section-body">
          <p>Click the ⚠ badge on any galaxy to read why it doesn't
          fit. Known cases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Foreground galaxies</strong>: NGC 7320 looks
              like part of Stephan's Quintet but its redshift puts
              it ten times closer than the others — they're just
              visually superimposed from our viewpoint.</li>
            <li><strong>Quasars</strong>: 3C 273 looks bright because
              its central black hole is feeding voraciously, not
              because it's nearby. At z ≈ 0.16 it's about 750 Mpc
              away.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep-field galaxies</strong>: at z &gt; 1,
              the simple v = c·z formula breaks down. Switch on
              "Include deep-field" in the graph options to see how
              they fall away from the Hubble's-law line at extreme
              distances.</li>

        <summary>What this all means</summary>
        <div class="info-section-body">
          <p>Hubble's law is the simplest description of an
          expanding universe. The fact that it works at all — that
          distant galaxies really do recede faster, in a roughly
          proportional way — is the strongest evidence we have that
          space itself is stretching. Every anomaly you see is
          either a story about local gravity (the Local Group) or a
          hint about the more sophisticated cosmological model that
          takes over at high redshift.</p>
