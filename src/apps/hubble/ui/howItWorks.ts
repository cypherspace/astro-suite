      <p>This app lets you reconstruct one of the most important
      graphs in astronomy: the <strong>Hubble diagram</strong>. Edwin
      Hubble first noticed in the 1920s that distant galaxies were
      moving away from Earth. He plotted a graph where he compared
      their distance to their speed. He found a mathematical
      relationship, called <strong>Hubble's Law</strong>. That
      relationship tells us how the Universe began; it's one of the
      most important findings physics has ever made. You're going to
      do the same thing Hubble did, and we expect that you'll find
      the same relationship.</p>

        <div class="info-section-body">
          <p>The left panel shows real images of the night sky from
          telescope surveys (DSS2, PanSTARRS, SDSS, 2MASS — switch
          between them at the top).</p>
          <p>We've marked some galaxies for you (but there are many,
          many more to discover). The ones we've marked have specific
          reasons for marking them. You might also see that different
          galaxies have badges on them; this tells you if there's
          more data about the galaxies; this might mean you can
          calculate the distance and speed yourself.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>✦ Cepheids</strong> — the Hubble Space
              Telescope has measured pulsating Cepheid stars in this
              galaxy, and you can use them to derive the distance to
              the galaxy.</li>
            <li><strong>λ Spectrum</strong> — the Sloan Digital Sky
              Survey (SDSS) has measured the light coming from the
              galaxy and plotted a graph of the spectrum. This means
              you can measure the <em>redshift</em> of the galaxy
              yourself, which tells us the speed.</li>

          <p>For each galaxy, you have three options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use the values that have been calculated by
              astronomers.</strong> Just click "Add to chart" and the
              chart will use the accepted values for distance and
              speed of that galaxy.</li>
            <li><strong>Find the distance yourself</strong> — for
              galaxies with the ✦ badge, open the Cepheid panel and
              follow the steps to see if you can find the distance,
              using the relationship between the period of a Cepheid
              star's brightening and dimming, and its overall
              brightness.</li>
            <li><strong>Find the redshift yourself</strong> — for
              galaxies with the λ badge, open the spectrum panel,
              identify a spectral line, and calculate the redshift of
              the galaxy.</li>

        <summary>3. Watch Hubble's law emerge</summary>
        <div class="info-section-body">
          <p>Once you have a few galaxies plotted, the app fits a
          straight line through them and reports the slope. The
          straight-line relationship is known as
          <strong>Hubble's Law</strong>. The gradient of the line is
          known as <strong>Hubble's Constant</strong>. Hubble
          originally calculated this as 66 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹; but Hubble
          didn't see as many galaxies as we can today, so you can get
          a more accurate value by using more galaxies at bigger
          distances.</p>
          <p>As you add more galaxies, you might see that value
          change. That's exactly what has happened over the last 100
          years — more measurements, and more galaxies, means we get
          different values as we get new measurements.</p>

          <p>In 1929, Edwin Hubble published a chart of 24 nearby
          galaxies showing this same straight-line relationship
          between distance and recession velocity. It was the first
          observational evidence that the universe is expanding —
          and led directly to the Big Bang theory. You're rebuilding
          his discovery with much better data.</p>
